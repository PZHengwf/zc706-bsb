zc706-bsb
=========

Project created with the Base System Builder for the ZC706

### Description

This is the standard project that is generated by Xilinx Platform Studio's Base System Builder
for the ZC706 evaluation board. It doesn't actually do anything useful apart from sending a "Hello World"
message over the serial port (UART over USB) but it serves as a base design for other projects that you
will find on fpgadeveloper.com.

### Requirements

* ISE Design Suite 14.7
* ZC706 Evaluation Board

### License

Feel free to modify the code for your specific application.

### Fork and share

If you port this project to another hardware platform, please send me the
code or push it onto GitHub and send me the link so I can post it on my
website. The more people that benefit, the better.
